# Using SDK with Polar wrist units

Polar wrist units such as Polar Ignite 3, Polar Pacer (Pro), Polar Grit X Pro 2 or Polar Vantage V3 support online streaming of some data types,
altough some special user action is required to be able to start the streaming feature and get the data.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Although the namings might be confusing, enabling the SDK on the wrist unit is not starting [SDK Mode](./SdkModeExplained.md) with `startSdkMode()` function. SDK Mode is currently not supported in Polar watches.
